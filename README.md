# tfa_base_rp_friendly
As the live version of the tfa_base continues to update I will update this repository with an RP friendly version. Ill either remove or make new functionality optional so server owners dont have to worry.


To install this please do the following in order: 
	- Download the file.
	- Extract the folder "tfa_base" out of the zip file.
	- Insert the tfa_base folder into your servers addons folder
	- Remove the sv/redux base from your servers collection.
	- Restart your server.
